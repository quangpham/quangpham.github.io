After waiting for about 2 months since I’ve baked on kickstarter, my Pebble Time arrived yesterday. My first impression is that the color e-paper display isn’t bad as I thought. In fact, it is super clear & sharp under the sunshine. Pebble Time has 7 days battery life and it is much more than “an all-day battery life” in iWatch.

I am so excited to play arround Pebble API for my first smartwatch app. Great product!
