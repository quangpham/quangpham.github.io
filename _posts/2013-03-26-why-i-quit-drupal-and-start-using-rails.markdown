During my time in Activeark, I have used Drupal in most of customer projects. Drupal gains a lot advantages over other framework (or CMS). It is easy to write, easy to setup and easy to use. The most important advantage is that it has been supported by a huge open source community (more than 1 million users). Some big companies like Nokia, Intel, The Economist, White house, etc has been using Drupal for their websites.

However, I have switched from Drupal to Ruby on Rails after using it for 2 years. [Here](https://www.urbaninsight.com/2014/07/16/drupal-vs-ruby-rails) are some reason why I did that.
