During the last 4 years, I have worked in 3 different companies. Every time I started working in the new company, I have to learn something totally new just like a newbie. It could a new programming language or a new framework. But am I afraid to change again? The answer is NO. And here are the reasons.

Because change is always coming. Especially in IT industry, new technology is always coming super fast. If you are afraid of trying new thing, you would be definitely out-of-date so quickly.

My story started when I was in university. At that time, my dream was to work for Nokia after graduation. I loved being a mobile developer and I have put a lot of efforts to learn about Qt framework ( one of the main framework to create mobile apps for Nokia at that time). I was very active in the Qt community an I have won some Nokia coding competitions. I was too confidence to believe that I would easily have a job in Nokia after graduation.

Lifeâ€™s always unexpected. The cooperation between Nokia and Microsoft has put the ending for my dream job in Nokia. After shaking hands, they decided to abandon Qt framework and Nokia is going to use Microsoft technology in their smartphone products. I was really shocked at that time. I have invested a lot of time (more than 3 years) and effort on Qt but it just became useless in a moment.

Luckily, unlike what I expected, I was enough to have good job after that. I became a web developer in Activeark. 

Web -> Mobile Web Apps -> Native Mobile Apps -> Game Development
