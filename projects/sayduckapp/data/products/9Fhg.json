The result combines the essential character of the first table lamp with mobile arms of the twentieth century with the next-generation LED source technology. The past is the present in its DNA, as revealed by its shape, its function, and the materials it is made of. I think each project should comply with certain minimum eco-sustainability standards, and all the materials used to create Lotek are recyclable. There is no future without past.” The structure is made of standard aluminium tubes simply and very visibly joined together like pieces in a children’s game – play is always an important component in Mariscal’s life and a constant presence in his designs.<br/><br/><b>INFORMATIONS:</b><br/>LED Total power 7,5Wn<br/>warm white 3000Kn<br/>Lighting Output 288lmn<br/>Dimmable, Infrared presence detector."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"9Fhg","order":"124"}
