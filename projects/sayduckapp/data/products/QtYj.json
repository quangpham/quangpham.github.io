The modern whitewashed timber pieces that make up this large collection have been specifically developed for the smart and casual interior style so characteristic of Australian homes.

Cancun’s simple styling allows the range to be extremely versatile and work in with just about any contemporary décor. As for individual pieces, there are plenty of attractive details. In the Cancun coffee table, there are two open compartments for interior storage of magazines and books.\r\n\r\n“The Cancun is still our number one timber range.
