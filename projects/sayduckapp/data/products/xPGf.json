{"info":{"partnerName":"Freedom","TransparentImageURL":"http://www.freedom.com.au/IgnitionSuite/ProductCatalogue/images/product/transparent/22920263.png","Dimensions":"168 cm x 110 cm x 215 cm","tags":["Freedom:Menu:Bedroom:Beds"],"price":"$1299","description":"Cancun is one of Freedom’s most popular furniture collections and it’s easy to see why. The modern whitewashed timber pieces that make up this large collection have been specifically developed for the smart and casual interior style so characteristic of Australian homes. A lot of the inspiration for the design of the Cancun collection comes from a coastal living aesthetic, but you won’t find any seashell motifs here. Cancun’s simple styling allows the range to be extremely versatile and work in with just about any contemporary décor. As for individual pieces, there are plenty of attractive details. In the Cancun range of bedroom furniture, each bed features a large rectangular wooden bedhead, solid timber rails, and slats on the base to support the mattress. The Cancun bed is available in the four sizes of king single, double, queen and king.\r\n\r\n“The Cancun is still our number one timber range. It’s so popular, we just keep on adding to it!” Freedom furniture buyer Lucie McCann.\r\n","LongDescription":"Cancun is one of Freedom’s most popular furniture collections and it’s easy to see why.
