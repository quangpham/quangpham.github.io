The pressure moulded veneer chair is a further development of the classic Ant™ chair. The four-legged stackable chair can be seen as the culmination of the use of the lamination technique. A technique refined to perfection during the Twenties and Thirties by Søren C. Hansen, the grandson of the founder, Fritz Hansen. The visionary Arne Jacobsen exploited the possibilities of lamination to perfection resulting in the iconic shape of the chair. Series 7 represents the chair in the Fritz Hansen collection with the widest range of applications. It is lightweight and stackable and offers options such as armrests, castors etc. We offer our stacking chairs in 9 different types of wood each with it´s own unique wood grain pattern, reflecting a comprehensive palette of natural wood tones and hues. What´s more, we also offer the same chairs in a range of painted versions, in truly distinctive colours to compliment your home or office."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"hU11","order":"B"}
