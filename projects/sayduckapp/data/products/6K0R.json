The lamp takes the form of an l-shaped, right-angled sculpture in aluminium: a reflector design that ensures a highly efficient use of the light. The lamps are dimensioned to suit the size of the reading tables and, to simplify the design, all moveable parts are integrated in the aluminium profile. The light source is a halogen bulb – a LED version with the best quality light and technology is also available. The lamp features UV-stop glass and uses an external transformer."},"id":"6K0R"}
