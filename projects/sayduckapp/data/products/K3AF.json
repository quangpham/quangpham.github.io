High interest in the expression potentials of this material resulted into co-operation with master glass blowers to gain full control of the special suppleness of Venetian glass and to work on the balance between surface and light, between subtle densities and transparencies. Hence clear, pure craft objects, each of them unique in all respects. Transparency and opacity are wisely dosed to obtain a glass that reflects light without glaring and without losing efficiency.<br/><br/><b>INFORMATIONS:</b><br/>Led Total power 22Wn<br/>warm white 3000Kn<br/>Lighting Output 1510, dimmer"},"status":"ENABLED","id":"K3AF","order":"179"}
