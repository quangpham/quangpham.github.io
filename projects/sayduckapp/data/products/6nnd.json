The modern whitewashed timber pieces that make up this large collection have been specifically developed for the smart and casual interior style so characteristic of Australian homes.

Cancun’s simple styling allows the range to be extremely versatile and work in with just about any contemporary décor. As for individual pieces, there are plenty of attractive details. In the Cancun console table, there are three roomy drawers featuring elegant silver ring-pull handles suggestive of the type used on storage lockers on sailing boats and yachts.\r\n\r\n“The Cancun is still our number one timber range.
