Without a lens, Open solves two of the most common issues with linear lighting products — seams between lenses and the accumulation of dirt, dust and dead pests atop the lens surface. Available in recessed and suspended forms, Open features direct and I/D distributions and three unique end cap options – transitional reveal, square reveal and flat conceal – each of which give the luminaire a distinct aesthetic."},"id":"VkSs"}
