Every piece is identical, making home assembly easy. The way it grows outwards with fingers reminds me of coral. I love to snorkel over reefs exploring the amazing detail and structure of all the various corals. Our kitsets significantly reduce freighting, which is one of our ways of doing what we can to help preserve our beautiful sea and land environments.” - David Trubridge"},"status":"ENABLED","id":"ykRa","order":"202"}
