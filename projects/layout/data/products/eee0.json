A series of pieces that look as if they grew just naturally in plastic where the leaves form a crown resting on a framework of branches which virtually form a seat. This two-seater sofa presented in 2011 and full of personality features a soft seat with topstitched embroidery and is now joined by a smaller cosy armchair. The topstitching covers the entire surface including the back to make the most of the aesthetic effect and can be placed anywhere in the living room and appreciated from any angle."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"eee0"}
