Louis Ghost is the most daring example in the world of injected polycarbonate in a single mould. Despite its evanescent and crystalline appearance, Louis Ghost is stable and durable, shock and weather resistant and can also be stacked six high. This article has great charm and considerable visual appeal and brings a touch of elegance and irony to any style of home or public area. Louis Ghost chairs can be personalised in four standard themes and with other items upon the customer√¢??s specific request with minimum orders of 10 pieces."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"dded"}
