HMY will suggest the suitable checkout setting for your business with the most appropriate components. Also, Axis is designed to easily integrate all the technological and automatic systems for the payment process. But Axis offers something else that provides a touch of distinction: the peripheral lighting in the upper part. Axis \"handles\" the light so that this becomes a functional element, not only aesthetic. This is another of the elements that can be completely personalized. We can define Axis as the technological, attractive, flexible and functional modular checkout system that can be installed in every sector. We offer a wide range of systems, from the simpler one to the most complete and specific."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"Xvbs"}
