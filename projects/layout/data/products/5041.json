This is the thinking behind the new TAPE lamp by architects Claudio Cambi, Francesco Scatena and David Turini. A simple coloured tape woven round a hoop becomes the statement and the defining element. The central light source illuminates the elegant geometric layout of the tape, which is the ultimate in complex simplicity; a LED strip light inside the circumference of the metal hoop conveys a subtle light onto the fabric, underlining the pure emotion of the design."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"5041"}
