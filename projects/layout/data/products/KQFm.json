Their iconic Eames Lounge Chair (1956) began with a desire to create a chair with “the warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman’s mitt.” In continuous production since its introduction in 1956, the Eames Lounge Chair is widely considered one of the most significant designs of the 20th century. Pairing soft, inviting leather with the sleek form of molded wood, this set was the culmination of the Eameses’ efforts to create a club chair using the molded plywood technology that they pioneered in the ’40s. Entirely hand-assembled out of parts that are fully replaceable by Herman Miller, the timeless Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman is constructed to last lifetimes. This original is an authentic, fully licensed product of Herman Miller, Inc. Eames is a licensed trademark of Herman Miller. Made in U.S.A. "},"status":"ENABLED","id":"KQFm"}
