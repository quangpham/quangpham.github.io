They work great socially - everyone will find a suitable height.Plopp stool is an icon and a bestseller of Zieta Prozessdesign. The unique, toy-looking and playful shape of Plopp is an effect of an innovative forming method – FIDU. FIDU technology means that two ultra-thin steel sheets are welded together around their edges and inflated under high pressure to give a 3d object. FIDU enables mass production of individualized shapes. Forms made in FIDU are very light but also very durable. Since its market release, Plopp stool has been shown on many exhibitions around the world and has won many prestigious awards – includuding Red Dot Design Award 2008, German Design Council Award 2008 and Forum AID Award 2009."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"K51k"}
