An achievement made possible only with OLED, Kindredâ€™s thin profile and curvature immerse the user in a soft volume of light and create a sense of companionship and comfort. When mounted in close proximity, it transforms the interaction within an interior space to a more personal experience. Even in the zero-energy state, Kindred exists in perfect harmony with the space, blurring the lines between architecture and lighting. Kindred and its use of OLED technology mark a new era in architectural lighting design where energy efficiency, quality lighting, and emotional resonance coexist."},"id":"jGYd"}
