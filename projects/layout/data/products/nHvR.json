The main body of the table functions as a box containing two parts that slide along the inside, making it possible to extend the table along its entire length. The extension is very simple and this piece is made even more attractive by the playful contrasts sparked off by the structural elements and colours. The Svedese table is bursting with personality and is a ideal piece of furniture to complement and meet the demands of different spaces, in both indoor and outdoor settings."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"nHvR","order":"123"}
