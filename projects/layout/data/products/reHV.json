In 1999 he created Lantern, a sculptured candle holder that is designed with clear and clean lines. Perfectly balanced between pure lines of mouth-blown glass, the candle creates an illusion of light floating in air. In 2013 this iconic classic is reborn also as an electric version. Electricity increases Lantern’s usability - the lighting fixture can be placed in a range of environments, such as between shelves or in public spaces. Lantern’s shape is strongly statuesque, which is why it works naturally with both electricity and a living flame."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"reHV"}
