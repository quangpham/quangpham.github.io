Re-interpreted in a space age key, the Series 7 by Arne Jacobsen, the Tulip Armchair by Eero Saarinen and the Eiffel Chair by Charles Eames weave into a most engaging and sinuous hybrid. Standing on four slim legs, the Masters chair is roomy and comfortable. The back of the chair is its most fascinating feature characterised by the fullnesses and empty spaces created by the curvaceous criss- crossing lines of three different backs which descend to merge into the edge of the seat."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"6f56"}
