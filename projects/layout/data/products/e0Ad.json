With this comment, Charles Eames initiated the development of the Lounge Chair, a process that took several years. The aim was to satisfy the desire for an amply proportioned chair that combined ultimate comfort with the highest quality materials and craftsmanship. With the design of this armchair in 1956, Charles and Ray Eames set new standards: it is not only lighter, more elegant and more modern than the conventionally ponderous club chair â€“ it is also more comfortable. With these qualities, the Lounge Chair became one of the most famous designs of Charles and Ray Eames and has attained the status of a classic in the history of modern furniture."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"e0Ad","order":"A"}
