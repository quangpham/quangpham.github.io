The modern whitewashed timber pieces that make up this large collection have been specifically developed for the smart and casual interior style so characteristic of Australian homes. A lot of the inspiration for the design of the Cancun collection comes from a coastal living aesthetic, but you won’t find any seashell motifs here. Cancun’s simple styling allows the range to be extremely versatile and work in with just about any contemporary décor. As for individual pieces, there are plenty of attractive details. In the Cancun tallboy, there are five roomy drawers featuring elegant silver ring-pull handles suggestive of the type used on storage lockers on sailing boats and yachts.\r\n\r\n“The Cancun is still our number one timber range. It’s so popular, we just keep on adding to it!” Freedom furniture buyer Lucie McCann. \r\n","LongDescription":"Cancun is one of Freedom’s most popular furniture collections and it’s easy to see why.
