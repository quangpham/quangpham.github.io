It has the same simple and timeless design as the original handmade glass fiber version from 2005, but is now injection molded recyclableÂ  polypropylene. The design has been slightly up scaled to give added back support and comfort, particularly important for applications such as meeting rooms, restaurants etc. The up scaled seat provides superb backrest support without compromising the simplicity and ease in which it can be handled. Furthermore, the added acoustic properties of polypropylene, as a material, adds value to the interior space by giving a soft and pleasant sound. Lars Vejen / shldesign"},"id":"K7V3"}
