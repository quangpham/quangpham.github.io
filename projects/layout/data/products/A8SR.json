In this particularpot, these two shapes meet in a lovely manner. For me, the best season of the year is Spring and this is why I have chosen to call this potPrimavera (Spring)\". This is how Eero Aarnio describes his new design for Serralunga. His are simple and direct words in harmony with his way of being and of living and with his creative rapidity and constantly alert intuition. The Finnish designer Eero Aarnio is one of the great innovators in modern furniture design. His latest creation for Serralunga is a tribute to the sculptural tradition that is a feature of the famous pots made by this company from Biella. It is large, classically-inspired cup, which is so simple yet so expressive that when we saw the design we asked ourselves why we hadnâ€™t manufactured it before."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"A8SR","order":"113"}
