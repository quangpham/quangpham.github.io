Kola is aesthetically and weight wise a light chair, making it fit both public and private modern interiors. The seat, available black or dark grey, is manufactured of 100% recyclable polyester felt which has also great acoustic absorption capacities. The frame is epoxy coated (black, white or yellow) or chromed steel. The felt seat can be renewed which gives the chair a longer life cycle and, accordingly, it leaves a smaller ecological footprint. The upholstered cushion gives extra comfort and allows the use of playful colours. With Kola you can create nice and friendly looking interiors. Kola Lounge suits exceptionally well in waiting areas and lounges."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"f048"}
