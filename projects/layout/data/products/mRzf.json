Its ingeniously proportioned, distinctive form has made this height-adjustable table into one of the most popular design icons of the 20th century. It is named after the summer house E 1027, Maison en Bord de Mer at Roquebrune Cap Martin, that Eileen Gray built for herself and for her collaborator, Jean Badovici. Likewise, the secret code-name comes from her: E is for Eileen, 10 for Jean (J is the 10th letter of the alphabet), 2 for B(adovici) and 7 for G(ray). Aram Designs Ltd. holds the Worldwide licence for Eileen Gray's designs."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"mRzf"}
