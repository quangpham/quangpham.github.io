Here's the winner, Je-Uk Kim's Lovebird. It's got two pull out units - a coffee table with a storage compartment, and a large cushion. Combine to make a stylish ottoman. We worked with the world's leading textile experts, Kvadrat, to pick the fabric. Just one touch and you'll understand the incredible quality.
