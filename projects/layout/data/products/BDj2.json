In the tradition of the English club chair, which inspired this classic design by Charles and Ray Eames, the original appearance of the Lounge Chair was defined by a dark wood veneer and black leather. However, the Eameses also created an early version with light-coloured leather upholstery. Developed in cooperation with the Eames Office, Vitra now introduces a new interpretation of the Lounge Chair. With white leather, polished aluminium and walnut veneer in a light finish, the new version harmonises perfectly with light-coloured interiors.<br> <br>Lounge Chair & Ottoman, designed by Charles and Ray Eames, all rights in Europe and the Middle East with Vitra, in the rest of the world with Herman Miller."},"status":"ENABLED","id":"BDj2","order":"A"}
