It is a limited edition of the 1980s running model X-CALIBER. The comfortable but street-savvy sneaker has a unique design that honours the stone grey, forest green and burgundy of the TGWO antique storefront. The collaboration between TGWO and Onitsuka Tiger, two authentic sneaker icons, proves that passion and dedication pay off. As the owners believe, “the good” will always prevail in the end. On sale at TGWO on December 7, 2013, and globally available on December 14, 2013. www.onitsukatiger.com www.thegoodwillout.com"},"status":"ENABLED","id":"4PCk","order":"0"}
